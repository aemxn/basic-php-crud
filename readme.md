BASIC PHP CRUD FUNCTIONS
========================

Too basic that I couldn't describe it any longer.

- Create a db named `test`
- Import `test.sql`
- Go to project folder, typically in `www` folder (eg. `localhost/basic-php-crud`)
- ???
- Profit

For my [blog entry](http://amnbhrmism.blogspot.com/2012/06/basic-crud-functions-for-php-mysql-xml.html) here.
